The project entails designing a custom PCB for an ESP32 chip that includes a Real Time Clock, SD card module, and USB connection. A 3.7V Lithium-ion battery will be used to provide power. The design process consists of component selection, schematic generation, PCB layout development, and extensive explanations of design decisions.
