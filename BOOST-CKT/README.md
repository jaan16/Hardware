# BOOST-CKT
BOOST CKT USING TPS63070RNMR
Boost Converter Circuit

## Purpose:

This schematic demonstrates a boost converter circuit designed to increase a 3V input voltage to a 3.3V output voltage. The circuit uses the TPS63070RNMR IC, which provides a compact and efficient solution for voltage-boosting applications.

## Components:

- TPS63070RNMR: This integrated circuit handles the power conversion and control functions of the boost converter.
- Capacitors: These components filter the input and output voltages, as well as provide stability to the circuit.
- Inductors: These components store energy during the switching cycle of the converter.
- Resistors: These components set the output voltage and current limits, as well as provide bias for the IC.

## Operation:

- Input Voltage: The circuit receives a 3V input voltage at the "Vin" terminal.
- Power Conversion: The TPS63070RNMR IC switches the input voltage to create a higher voltage across the inductor.
- Energy Storage: The inductor stores energy during the switching cycle.
- Output Voltage: The stored energy in the inductor is released to the output, raising the voltage to 3.3V at the "Vout" terminal.
- Regulation: The IC continuously monitors the output voltage and adjusts the switching frequency to maintain the desired output voltage.

### Applications:

- Powering 3.3V devices from a 3V battery: This circuit can be used to power devices that require a 3.3V supply, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and other electronic components.
- Voltage boosting for low-voltage systems: This circuit can be used to increase the voltage in various low-voltage applications.
